# Inspiration
The idea to build this project came after i decided to build a full functioning E-Com Website. Basically i need to manage my database in a good manner so that it can be maintained when i start to use my E-COM Website. Maintaining Data which are needed for the website to work is a crucial job for a Full Stack Developer. Also i needed to take into account that these data can be changed at any time and the Main Website should reflect this positively. I learned various things from this project and it has accounted to my great growth in my backend skills. 

# How it Works
This website has 4 main routes :-
1. Main Route :- Main Route shows all the data entries present in the DB.
2. Add Item Route :- Here we can add item and all its features,highlights,price etc and store it to the DB.
3. About Page :- Self-explanatory.
4. Contact Us Page :- Self-explanatory.

# API Calls
Various APIs provide means to add, delete, edit an item in the database. They are as follows :-
1. "/api/getSingleItem" - for getting a single Item (for Edit).
2. "/api/getItems" - To get all items present in DB.
3. "/api/addItems" - To add Item in the DB.
4. "/api/deleteItem" - To Delete an Item in DB.
